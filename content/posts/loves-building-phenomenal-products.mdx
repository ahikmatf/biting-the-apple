While I was searching for a job like months back, I found a lot of job requirements that are kinda not on my scope of capability yet, so this is going to be a journey of mine, commenting few of them through a blog post. Even though I am not an expert, this is just probably a train of thought that I want to share with the readers. Hopefully, you'll gain something. Haha. Haha.

So, the title is the points listed on the job posting, and let's breakdown, what are they trying to stress here. I can see the word `building`, `phenomenal`, `meaning`, `value`, and `people`. A bit too much what they are expecting in a single point here, but what can we say, HR will always try to find a good, best, or even an impossibly awesome candidate. XIXIXI.

Loves building products, in my opinion, is all about finding people with experience that was built through many failed or even successful projects before they joined this company. So hopefully candidates won't be using this company as a place for experiments anymore. Why? Well, if you were just graduated from university, you might not a lot, but not always be the better fit approach for the problem, then you will end up trying things here and there, and voila, a working product with the unknown quality of code :)

Phenomenal, a word that never ever crosses my mind if I think about software, more like when you describe a performance, not a digital product per se. But HR will always try to find a seemingly cool words to make them look extraordinary. Coming to understand the word, building phenomenal product could be part of your daily activity, however, I can see that they are hoping you will be the leading person who initiates an amazing idea while no other people in the company will be much help to you. That role I think should be more part of a collaboration of RnD, PM, Marketing, BD, Design, with the help of the Developer perspective. Due to the fact that Developer will be the one executing their idea, will be too exhaustive if all was developer job.

Real meaning and add real value to people's lives. What a utopia. I get it. You want me to make it has meaning, yet this is not the candidate's company. They might just be working for money, and the company is the one with the dream. The company can hope that candidates will help them reach that target, though you can't really take that for granted, even a sense of ownership of the product is indeed needed, it's only to some degree.

That's it for now.
