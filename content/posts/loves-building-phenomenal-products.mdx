While I was searching for a job like months back, I found a lot of job requirements that kinda not on my scope of capability yet, so this is going to be a journey of mine, commenting few of them through a blog post. Even though I am not an expert, this is just probably a train of thought that I want to share with the readers. Hopefully you'll gain something. Haha. Haha.

So, the title are the points that listed on the job posting, and let's breakdown, what are they trying to stress here. I can see the word `building`, `phenomenal`, `meaning`, `value`, and `people`. Bit too much what they are expecting in a single points here, but what can we say, HR will always trying to find a good, best, or even impossibly awesome candidate. XIXIXI.

Loves building product in my opinion were all about finding people with experience that was built through many failed or even success project before they joining this company. So hopefully candidate won't be using this company as a place for experiment anymore. Why? Well, if you were just graduated from university, you might not a lot, but not always the better fit approach for the problem, then you will end up trying things here and there and voila, a working product with unknown quality of code :)

Phenomenal, a word that never ever cross my mind if I think about software, more like when you describe a performance, not a digital product per se. But HR will always try to find a seemingly cool words to make them looks extraordinary. Coming to understand the word, building phenomenal product could be part of your daily activity, however I can see that they are hoping you will be the leading person who initiate an amazing idea while no other people in the company will be much help to you. That role I think should be more part of a collaboration of RnD, PM, Marketing, BD, Design, with the help of Developer perspective. Due to the fact that Developer will be the one executing their idea, will be too exhaustive if all was developer job.



Real meaning and add real value to people's live. What a utopia. I get it. You want me to make it has meaning, yet this is not candidate's company. They might just be working for money, and company are the one with the dream. Company can hope that candidate's will help them reaching that target, though you can't really make that as a priority even sense of ownership of the product is indeed needed. To some degree.



That's it for now.
